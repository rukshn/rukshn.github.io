<p>After I finished writing the post, I wanted to share it on Reddit JavaScript community, r/javascript at the same time I shared it on HackerNews.</p>
<p>I have seen lot of comments on HackerNews criticizing the new Reddit design, using JavaScript and breaking in their mobile website, and constant nags pushing the users to their mobile app.</p>
<p>I was one of those few who liked their new design on desktop, no page loads between posting something, lot of white spaces, I feel most of the average users would be feeling the same, except for the tech community. But as a service Reddit should be looking at the common denominator, not the outliers.</p>
<p>I’m annoyed with the mobile app nag, when I visit the mobile website, Reddit is always asking me to download the mobile app. But I just cancel it and move along in the mobile browser.</p>
<p>But what happened yesterday just took me off the ledge. When I visited the r/javascript community on my iPad, I was greeted with this screen.</p>

<p>This community is only available in the app.</p>
<p>Why do you block me from from visiting the community from my mobile device?</p>
<p>Will the whole mobile website is scrapped and you end up with a landing page to download the mobile app?</p>
<p><strong>If you want to visit a popular subreddit</strong>, <strong>install our up and use it, or else login.</strong></p>
<p>I’ve managed to see the subreddit by requesting the desktop website, but I’m sure they will figure out a way, by checking the screen size to block this as well.</p>
