      <guid>http://localhost:1313/my-first-publication-and-my-thoughts-on-academia/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Few years ago I was someone was not interested in academia, I felt as if people are rehashing the same scientific topic in different ways, or publishing every minute thing just to add up to their pile of publications. I never thought I&amp;rsquo;d be able to write a publication under 200 words, the very idea of expressing something meaningful in such a short number of words was something that I could not agree with.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I feel as if the AI hype has peeked, and I am very skeptical about the AI wave that&amp;rsquo;s happening where majority of the ideas are chatGPT wrappers.</description>

      <title>The Art of Writing Abstracts</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have never been interested in academia and research. I always felt research and academia, or a majority of what people publish is just to fill their profiles with the number of publications. When I think about research, I always think about doing research as something groundbreaking. I remember telling colleagues (and I still do) to read the Page Rank algorithm [&lt;a href=&#34;http://infolab.stanford.edu/pub/papers/google.pdf&#34;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~mkearns/teaching/NetworkedLife/pagerank.pdf&#34;&gt;link 2&lt;/a&gt;] publication that formed the backbone of Google search in the beginning. I wanted every research or publication to be something like Page Rank.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve not been able to write something new lately, in fact, I think this is the first post of the year. So happy new year 2024, insert :tada: emoji. So I’ve been pretty much busy with work, and travelling, networking at conferences, the usual. At the start of 2023, I had never left Sri Lanka in my whole life, but by the end of 2023, I’d visited 5 different countries, including the US.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I haven’t posted on my blog for a long time, partly because I have been super busy with my personal and work life. I moved to Switzerland to work as a health informatics specialist for the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute, and moving to Switzerland in a very short period has been a change that took some time for me to get used to. There were cultural, administrative, and legal things I had not been used to while in Sri Lanka. I have yet to move to my apartment and live in a studio apartment at the time of writing this. It’s good that I moved to central Europe during the summer and excited to experience my first winter. Now back to what I wanted to tell you about.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Recently I had to do some text editing and was in need of a text editor that was better than Notepad, and with muscle memory, I went on and tried to download VSCodium. However, the download was like 100+ megabytes in size and since I was using a public internet connection that would make me wait for several good minutes to complete the download.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;VS Code has been my primary text editor/ IDE for several years. “Brackets” was my initial IDE for web development, then I moved to “Atom” and ended up with VS Code.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I was shown a product marketing itself as providing geological data layer for apps. A sketchy product at a glance and maybe scammy in the worst case. The developer is unable to provide direct answers and finding it difficult to provide details on how the product really works.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I wrote a short post about why you should work on interesting problems instead of interesting technologies. I never thought that it would reach front page on HN and receive so many responses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I first began learning programming with basic and pascal, our computer class started teaching us Java. As for a 10 year old it was hard for me to grasp the concept of object oriented programming. It took me another 10 years to partially grasp the concept of OOP, and another 10 years to completely understand OOP.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I was having a lecture about information security and information security law. I just started the module and this is the third lecture about the topic. And todays lecture was about different IT threats that an health information system would face. The lecture mainly revolved around malware. During the lecture, the teacher told a point that most malware today are written for profit, and ransomware are popular today because it’s a get rich scheme for malware writers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In April I made a decision that I wanted to make for a very long time. Delete my Facebook and Instagram accounts. I wanted to delete my Facebook and IG accounts for a while. I have even applied to delete my account several times in the past, only to reactivate it within few days. However, this time it was different. I was committed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/buddhism-and-meditation-is-not-the-same/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I got to read a post titled &lt;a href=&#34;https://danlawton.substack.com/p/when-buddhism-goes-bad&#34;&gt;“When Buddhism Goes Bad”&lt;/a&gt;, the title incised me to read it. Even though I was born as a Buddhist I never gave Buddhism much of a thought other than trying to pass my exam in region at school. Then since I learned biology, and had interest in technology for almost 30 years the only religion I believed was science.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>3 Important Lessons I Learnt Working At A Covid-19 ICU</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m writing a blog post after a very long time. This is because I was appointed to work at a COVID-19 intensive care unit for 2 months, and I was busy working there. When I started my work in May the COVID-19 cases were on the rise, and there were not enough doctors to take care of them. So me and some of my colleagues were taken out from our routine course-work from my Health Informatics MSc and was sent to different treatment centers around the country to take care of the rising COVID-19 case load.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
