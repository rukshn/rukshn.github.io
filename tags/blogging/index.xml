      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have several WordPress blogs, related to different topics. Including my personal blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each day I have to moderate several comments on all of my blogs, which are made my people trying to boost their SEO to their websites, most of them are selling fake medications, or fake online offers, or people trying to build back links to rank higher on Google results.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
