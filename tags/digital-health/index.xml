      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently a college contacted me asking how they can install DHIS2 on a Windows server which they have just received on their premises.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The data protection act in Sri Lanka is a highly awaited and timely act to enable data protection in Sri Lanka. It was passed in the parliament on 9th March 2022 [1]. Even though there are similar acts to protect personal data in other countries such as the HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) since 1996 and the GDPR (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) since 2016.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
