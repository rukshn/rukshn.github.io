There has not been any significant development in RSS for the last 10 years, and that’s fine.\nI was a FeedBurner Google Reader user until Google decided to shut it down. Then I jumped between Feedly, NewsBlur, and a couple of other RSS readers and they were not the same.\nBecause I was unable to find a good RSS reader that works across all my devices, I gave up using RSS for the last 5-6 years. Then recently I saw a post on HackerNews about NetNewsWire, a free and open-source RSS reader that works across all my devices.\nOnly after started reading RSS again did I realize how much I was missing, and millions out there are missing a great experience to consume content because they don’t know about RSS or gave up using RSS like me when Google decided to kill FeedBurner GoogleReader.\nThe user experience of many websites has slowly deteriorated in the last few years, and we have slowly gotten used to these changes, we’ve forgotten how easy it was to read something from a website a decade or so ago.\nFrom cookie consent banners, to ads covering most of the screen, to popups and to various other distractions that keep us away from what we visited the website in the first place, to consume a piece of content.\nRSS allows you to just consume content without any of these ads and distractions. However, this is the very thing that content creators want to avoid.\nWith RSS there is little chance of users seeing any ads, and content creators want to keep a user as long as possible consuming content on their website, as more time spent means more chance for ad revenue.\nFor this very reason, most websites now don’t maintain an RSS feed.\nCompare my experiences in reading an article from a website with and RSS the reader.
