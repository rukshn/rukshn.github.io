  <div class="post-content"><p>Today hackers were able to briefly take over the <a href="https://google.lk">Google.lk</a> domain, the Google‚Äôs search engine page for Sri Lanka and redirect it to bring awareness to an ongoing crisis in Sri Lanka.</p>

<p>Yes Kevin Rose, I got your email address since 2013 üòâ</p>
<p>I‚Äôm sure the government will look into this, and we might be able to find out who did this, and how they did it in the coming days.</p>
<p>Sri Lanka has to really think hard about their cyber security, even though startups tend to be more secure, the government websites and services are more hit and miss.</p>
