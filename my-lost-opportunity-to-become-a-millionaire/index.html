I had a 30 minute train ride from where I’m staying to my campus, where I spend my time on reading technology blogs like TechCruch or Mashable, or things I find on Google.\nOne day, there was an article on a virtual currency called Bitcoin, invented by an anonymous Japanese scientist/mathematician called Satoshi Nakamoto. People can create new bitcoins by mining on their computers, and one Bitcoin was around $20.\nPlus unlike today, it was easy to mine bitcoins and you don’t need a gpu farm to mine good enough bitcoins.\nInitially I wanted to buy some bitcoins. During that time my whole monthly expenses were around $20, and I was getting money from my parents. Since I’m a freshman at college, and I didn’t have enough money to buy bitcoin.\nI also thought that this virtual currency is not a good investing option, and it will implode and even if I invest some money to buy bitcoins, I would end up losing all the money I just invested.\nI also loved the idea of mining, I wanted to setup a mining software in one of my university computers, I was planning on installing mining software on every computer and hopefully making a mining network.\nBut with university work and exams I was unable to set up a mining device, and I forgot the idea about Bitcoins.\nThen I heard about Bitcoin when it hit $1,000 per Bitcoin, and then the price of Bitcoin went to $5,000 then to $10,000, up and up, and mining became harder and harder, to a point where you need huge GPU farms to mine a single Bitcoin.\nNow it’s difficult to invest, and difficult to mine a singe Bitcoin.\nNow in 2020 the price of a Bitcoin is $24,000+, I can invest in bitcoins, but I can’t buy a single Bitcoin like it was 2020. I wish I invested $2000 to buy 100 bitcoins 10 years ago. Today, at the end of 2020 I would have been a happy millionaire.\nBy then none of my friends knew about Bitcoin, but today when people share about Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency, it gives me bitter sweet memories about the opportunity I missed.\nI guess, you can live your life forward, but you can only understand it looking backwards.\n",
