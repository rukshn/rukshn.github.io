      <description>&lt;p&gt;Few years ago I was someone was not interested in academia, I felt as if people are rehashing the same scientific topic in different ways, or publishing every minute thing just to add up to their pile of publications. I never thought I&amp;rsquo;d be able to write a publication under 200 words, the very idea of expressing something meaningful in such a short number of words was something that I could not agree with.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have never been interested in academia and research. I always felt research and academia, or a majority of what people publish is just to fill their profiles with the number of publications. When I think about research, I always think about doing research as something groundbreaking. I remember telling colleagues (and I still do) to read the Page Rank algorithm [&lt;a href=&#34;http://infolab.stanford.edu/pub/papers/google.pdf&#34;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~mkearns/teaching/NetworkedLife/pagerank.pdf&#34;&gt;link 2&lt;/a&gt;] publication that formed the backbone of Google search in the beginning. I wanted every research or publication to be something like Page Rank.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
