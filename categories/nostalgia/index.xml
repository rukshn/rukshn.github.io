      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I was having a lecture about information security and information security law. I just started the module and this is the third lecture about the topic. And todays lecture was about different IT threats that an health information system would face. The lecture mainly revolved around malware. During the lecture, the teacher told a point that most malware today are written for profit, and ransomware are popular today because itâ€™s a get rich scheme for malware writers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
