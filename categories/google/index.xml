      <title>Google Search Has To Innovate or Die</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Google when it first came out as a search engine was innovative in so many different aspects from search engines that preceded Google. From better ranking algorithm over simply counting keywords, cleaner UI with no banner ads or popups, rather than trying to keep users on their website Google just provided a better search experience overall.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Art of Writing Abstracts</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have never been interested in academia and research. I always felt research and academia, or a majority of what people publish is just to fill their profiles with the number of publications. When I think about research, I always think about doing research as something groundbreaking. I remember telling colleagues (and I still do) to read the Page Rank algorithm [&lt;a href=&#34;http://infolab.stanford.edu/pub/papers/google.pdf&#34;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~mkearns/teaching/NetworkedLife/pagerank.pdf&#34;&gt;link 2&lt;/a&gt;] publication that formed the backbone of Google search in the beginning. I wanted every research or publication to be something like Page Rank.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I know this is going to sound just like another complaint against Google, but I want my Google results to be better.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every week or twice a week, you will come across a post on HackerNews that Google is dying or Google is awful. There are some valid points to some of their arguments. However, I don’t see Google going anywhere anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why Google needs to build an open chat client like Element</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/element_hq/status/1355290296947499013&#34;&gt;Google recently blocked the Matrix based chat app Element from the Play Store sighting sexual content on the platform.&lt;/a&gt; It’s really hard to define the explanation because WhatsApp, Telegram users of other chat clients also share the same content. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.redpoints.com/blog/telegram-book-piracy/&#34;&gt;Telegram is also known to host groups sharing pirated content as well.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post will might be the post that will roast me the most. But before triggering your fingers just by reading the title I would like everyone to read my post, and read my argument before jumping in to conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I sold my old MacBook Pro, and until I buy myself a new laptop, I had to log in to my gmail account from a windows laptop.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>I just checked Yamu stats, they don’t look good. Is Google killing Yamu?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yamu was started out as an idea in a hackathon back in 2011 or 2012 (I can’t remember the exact time), but it’s close to a decade. The original idea was to start something that was close to Uber or PickMe.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
