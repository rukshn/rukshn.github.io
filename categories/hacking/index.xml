      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday a tweet by Duminda, a fellow developer on Twitter, caught my eye. In that tweet he said that he has been warned by &lt;a href=&#34;https://haveibeenpwned.com/&#34;&gt;Have I Been Pwned&lt;/a&gt; about a data breach at &lt;a href=&#34;https://payhere.lk/&#34;&gt;PayHere&lt;/a&gt;, an online payment processor in Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I was having a lecture about information security and information security law. I just started the module and this is the third lecture about the topic. And todays lecture was about different IT threats that an health information system would face. The lecture mainly revolved around malware. During the lecture, the teacher told a point that most malware today are written for profit, and ransomware are popular today because it’s a get rich scheme for malware writers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week government launched its online covid tracker called the &amp;ldquo;StaySafe&amp;rdquo; program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The program which is similar to Stay Safe was launched in China, a QR code-based system. Where people should scan a QR code when they enter a location, a government server will save and track their check-in and check-out depending on the QR code scanning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
