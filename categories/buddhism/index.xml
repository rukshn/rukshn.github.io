      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I got to read a post titled &lt;a href=&#34;https://danlawton.substack.com/p/when-buddhism-goes-bad&#34;&gt;“When Buddhism Goes Bad”&lt;/a&gt;, the title incised me to read it. Even though I was born as a Buddhist I never gave Buddhism much of a thought other than trying to pass my exam in region at school. Then since I learned biology, and had interest in technology for almost 30 years the only religion I believed was science.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
