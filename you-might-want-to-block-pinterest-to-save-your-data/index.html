<p>Most of you are enjoying unlimited internet at your homes, but sadly [https://ruky.me/sri-lanka-need-unlimited-internet-connections/&quot;](I’m coming from a part of the world that charges according to the data I use.)</p>
<p>I basically pay for my <strong>home broadband</strong> data and I have monthly cap, and if I exceed that data limit I will have to buy an expensive data add-on. So data is something precious to me.</p>
<p>In the month of December, may be due to a technical error by the ISP my data add-on finished and I made a tweet criticizing them.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/JustRuky/status/1344554873744855040">https://twitter.com/JustRuky/status/1344554873744855040</a></p>
<p>The ISP was kind enough to reach out to me and I received an email detailing the data use of my internet connection.</p>
<p>It is a table with the websites/protocols I used, the data transmitted to that website/protocol in bytes.</p>
<p>One thing that immediately caught my eye was what’s at number 2, it was <strong>Pinterest</strong></p>
<p>Before I get into more detail, I want to tell you that I’m not an active Pinterest user, I don’t use their app on my mobile device. The only way I land on Pinterest is when I go to their website from Google image search results.</p>
<p><strong>The 17 connections to Pinterest has downloaded more than 1GB of data</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>There has been 17 connections to Pinterest and Pinterest has sent me more than 1.2GB of data.</strong></p>
<p>Even the 2000+ requests to Facebook has only downloaded roughly 300MB of data.</p>
<p>Why Pinterest is sending so much data in just 17 requests? What do they contain?</p>
<p>Maybe they are preloading or caching images for better user experience. But still 1.28GB of images is likely to have more than 1000 images.</p>
