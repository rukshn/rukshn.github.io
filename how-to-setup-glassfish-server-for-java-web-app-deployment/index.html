I know it was easy to deploy it using NetBeans because it has been developed with NetBeans and Glassfish. However, I wanted to run it without NetBeans because I don’t have NetBeans setup on my computer and I NetBeans currently doesn’t have the native M1 support.\nAfter some googling and reading though hours of different tutorials, StackOverflow answers, troubleshooting various problems I was able to setup the web app on my computer.\nNow that I got it working, I decided to write this post combining everything so that someone who wants to deploy a Java web app on Glassfish remotely or locally can get some idea on how to do it.\nI’ll be writing on how to deploy it on a remote server (a DigitalOcean Droplet) but you can follow the same steps for deploying it on your localhost.\nSetup a LAMP server If your web app is using MySql, it’s easy to get started with a LAMP server (Linux, Apache, MySql, PHP).\nWhen you create a new droplet on DigitalOcean you can easily select a LAMP server from their market place. It install the current stable Ubuntu LTS version, and automatically open up port 80 for web traffic and install MySql and setup a user and you can manipulate the database with it.\nYou can get more details about the LAMP server on DigitalOcean here – https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/lamp\nI don’t think Apache and PHP is necessary, and you can use a different database management system instead of MySql. But it’s easy to set up a LAMP server, on DigitalOcean on a computer, but it’s not a must. Simply having Ubuntu or any other Linux distro would be enough.\nInstall Java, JDK I ran into a small problem at this point. There are different “branches” of GlassFish available out there. If you search on Google you will find the following page as its top result. https://javaee.github.io/glassfish/. However, this branch hasn’t been updated since 2019, and you can download GlassFish version 5 from the following website.\nThe latest update of GlassFish are available on Eclipse foundation website – https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j.glassfish/downloads\nOn the Eclipse foundation website you will be able to download the newest version of GlassFish which is GlassFish 6.2 at the time of writing.\nGlassFish 5 only supports JDK 1.8, Java 8 and will not work on the latest Java version at the time of writing which is Java 11.\nGlassFish 6 on the other hand will support JDK 1.11, Java 11.\nDepending on the version of the GlassFish that you are going to use, install Java 8 or Java 11. You can do it with the following commands.\nsudo apt update sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk java -version This should show your Java version as follows.\nopenjdk version \"11.0.7\"..... If you are using GlassFish 5, install Java version 8.\nsudo apt update sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk java -version And your Java version should be like this\nopenjdk version \"1.8.0_191\".... Install Glassfish Now it’s time to install Glassfish, depending on the version of Java that you installed, install the appropriate Glassfish version.\nIf you are installing Glassfish 5\nwget http://download.oracle.com/glassfish/5.0.1/release/glassfish-5.0.1-web.zip If you are installing Glassfish 6\nwget https://download.eclipse.org/ee4j/glassfish/web-6.2.0.zip Unzip your Glassfish download. I suggest you unzip it to the /opt/ folder\nsudo mv web-6.2.0.zip /opt/ cd /opt/ sudo unzip web-6.2.0.zip If unzip ins not install you can install unzip on Ubuntu like this, if it’s not already installed,\nsudo apt update sudo apt install unzip Setting up Glassfish Create a new service file\nsudo vim /etc/systemd/system/glassfish.service Enter the following details to your Glassfish.service file and make sure to use the path where you extracted the Glassfish zip file. The below file assumes that you have used Glassfish version 5 and you have extracted Glassfish zip file to /opt/ folder.\nIf you are using Glassfish 6 change glassfish5 to glassfish6\n[Unit] Description = GlassFish Server v5.0 After = syslog.target network.target [Service] ExecStart=/opt/glassfish5/bin/asadmin start-domain ExecReload=/opt/glassfish5/bin/asadmin restart-domain ExecStop=/opt/glassfish5/bin/asadmin stop-domain Type = forking [Install] WantedBy = multi-user.target Save the file and reload the system services.\nsudo systemctl daemon-reload Enable Glassfish at boot\nsudo systemctl enable glassfish To start Glassfish\nsudo systemctl start glassfish To stop Glassfish\nsudo systemctl stop glassfish Restart Glassfish\nsudo systemctl restart glassfish After starting Glassfish server you will be able to access though the following address\nhttp://:8080 http://localhost:8080 You can also access Glassfish admin console by visiting the port 4848\nhttp://:4848 http://localhost:4848 However, you won’t be able to login to the admin console unless you are running it on your localhost. If you are running it on a DigitalOcean Droplet, you won’t be able to access the admin console without enabling secure admin.\nIf you are accessing admin console the default username is admin. Leave the password field blank.\nOpen ports 8080 and 4848 If you are running a DigitalOcean Droplet, usually your 8080 and 4848 ports are not open. You can open them by running the following commands.\nufw allow 8080 uff allow 4848 Glassfish enable-secure-admin You can enable secure-admin by running the following command.\n/opt/glassfish5/bin/asadmin enable-secure-admin However, I came across this problem where after enabling secure admin I was unable to run any command though the asadmin admin command. I got a security error. This was probably because some certificate key mismatch, and I was unable to find a solution for it.\nHowever, if you are using this as a development server, which in my case I’m using it for development purposes, or if you are using it on your localhost, then you don’t have to enable secure admin.\nAdd Glassfish to your path You can add Glassfish to your path by using the following command. It will make it possible for you to run Glassfish from (asadmin) anywhere.\nexport PATH=/opt/glassfish5/bin:$PATH If you did everything correctly, you should be able to see the Glassfish welcome page by visiting your remote server IP/localhost on port 8080.\nThis is a basic introduction on how to setup a Glassfish server to deploy a Java web app. Since this post is relatively long, I will write another post on how you can deploy a Java web app on your newly setup Glassfish server.\n",

<p>If you are running a DigitalOcean Droplet, usually your 8080 and 4848 ports are not open. You can open them by running the following commands.</p>

<p>You can enable secure-admin by running the following command.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>    /opt/glassfish5/bin/asadmin enable-secure-admin
</code></pre><p>However, I came across this problem where after enabling secure admin I was unable to run any command though the asadmin admin command. I got a security error. This was probably because some certificate key mismatch, and I was unable to find a solution for it.</p>
<p>However, if you are using this as a development server, which in my case I’m using it for development purposes, or if you are using it on your localhost, then you don’t have to enable secure admin.</p>
<h2 id="add-glassfish-to-your-path">Add Glassfish to your path<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#add-glassfish-to-your-path">#</a></h2>
<p>You can add Glassfish to your path by using the following command. It will make it possible for you to run Glassfish from (<code>asadmin</code>) anywhere.</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>If you did everything correctly, you should be able to see the Glassfish welcome page by visiting your remote server IP/localhost on port 8080.</p>
<p>This is a basic introduction on how to setup a Glassfish server to deploy a Java web app. Since this post is relatively long, I will write another post on how you can deploy a Java web app on your newly setup Glassfish server.</p>
