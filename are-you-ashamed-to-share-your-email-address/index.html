I created a short, somewhat funny, and hard to spell email address by using my initials and how my fiends used to call me at school.\nDuring that time, the email address seemed cool, and I registered to all the websites using that email. Recently when I asked for an email from a friend, he gave me a dorky email address, which he might have registered while he was at school or university. Even thought I never told it to his face, I laughed at myself thinking that he must have registered this email address just like me, when\nHowever, now since I’m doing a job, I feel very embarrassed to share my dorky email I created when I was 15. I don’t want people to make fun of it. And I also feel very unprofessional when I use the email address for my work. I also don’t want to switch to a new email address which is long and difficult to pronounce and easy for anyone to misspell.\nI’m sure I’m not the only one who has faced a similar situation, I’m sure there are quite a lot of people who has created dorky email addresses who now feel embarrassed to share with others.\nOne option I have is to create a separate email account, and forward all the emails to my old email account. Which then I can read though the same inbox.\nI also feel like buying a domain name with my name, so I can create an email like hi@myname.xyz so it will look cool, and forward all the emails to my regular email address. But then again I have to pay for a domain name which is a small sum but still I’m afraid if I miss renewing the domain name, or someone else use some social engineering or some wired hack to claim my domain name (which has happened to popular domains before, like perl), I will be losing access to all my emails and accounts that I will use to signup from that email.\nSo I’m guessing what to do, switch to a new email maybe something like hey.com, but I don’t know. Has anyone felt ashamed about your old email addresses? What did you do?\n",
